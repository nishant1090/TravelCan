# TravelCan Hybrid Application

The **TravelCan** hybrid application helps users find travel partners (flight/car-share) and people to share accommodation with.  
It was developed to address the challenges faced by international students when moving to a new country for studies.  
This application can be very helpful in the early stages of emigration — having a buddy always makes life easier! 😊
